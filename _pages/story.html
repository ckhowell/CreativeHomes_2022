          <p class="lead">The Creative Homes philosophy to architecture and building is elegant and simple. Designing unique houses that make the most out of the position. Working with the aspect and natural surroundings to compliment rather than infringe. </p>
          <p>We focus on the details and craftsmanship. We aim to understand our client needs and deliver a beautiful home. Our repeat client√®le is testimony of our reputation.</p>
          <p>Striving to make the least amount of impact on the land and taking the challenge to turn what would be considered a negative aspect into a positive. We can design for steep, narrow and other challenging blocks of land. </p>
          <p>We understand that this is one of the biggest events and investments in your life and we understand the importance it has to both you and your family.</p>
          <p>Creative Homes will follow the project all the way from start to finish. From obtaining all the relevant building and planning permits to organising the trades from our dedicated and outstanding team of tradesmen.</p>
